# Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
# We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
# You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
