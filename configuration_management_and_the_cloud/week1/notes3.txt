domain specific language
eg puppet
variables conditional_statements functions are dsl of puppet
facts variables that represent the characteristics of the system. When the Puppet agent runs

is $facts['is_virtual']{
  package { 'smartmontools':
    ensure => purged,
    }
 } else {
  package { 'smartmontools':
    ensure => installed,
    }
  }

-------------------------------------
idempotent action
an idempotent action can be performed over and over again without changing the system after the first time the action was performed, and with no unintended side effects

file { '/etc/issue':
  mode   => '0644',
  content => "Internal system \l \n", 
}

exception exec resource

use of onlyif in exec resource to turn into idempotent

exec { 'move example file':
  command => 'mv/home/user/example.txt /home/user/Desktop',
  onlyif => 'test -e /home/user/example.txt',
}
