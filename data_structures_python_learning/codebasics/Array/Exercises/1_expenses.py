# My solution
# 1. Let us say your expense for every month are listed below,
# 	1. January -  2200
#  	2. February - 2350
#     3. March - 2600
#     4. April - 2130
#     5. May - 2190
#
# Create a list to store these monthly expenses and using that find out,
#
# 1. In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?
# 2. Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year.
# 3. Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
# 4. June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
# 5. You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and
# got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list
# based on this
exp = [2200, 2350, 2600, 2130, 2190]
# q1
print(exp[1] - exp[0])
# q2
print(sum(exp[:3]))
# q3
count = 0
for i in exp:
    if i > 2000:
        count += 1
if count > 1:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("No")
# q4 
exp.append(1980)
print(exp)
# q5
exp[3] = exp[3] - 200
print(exp)


# instructor's solution
exp = [2200,2350,2600,2130,2190]

# 1. In Feb, how many dollars you spent extra compare to January?
print("In feb this much extra was spent compared to jan:",exp[1]-exp[0]) # 150

# 2. Find out your total expense in first quarter (first three months) of the year
print("Expense for first quarter:",exp[0]+exp[1]+exp[2]) # 7150

# 3. Find out if you spent exactly 2000 dollars in any month
print("Did I spent 2000$ in any month? ", 2000 in exp) # False

# 4. June month just finished and your expense is 1980 dollar. Add this item to our monthly expense list
exp.append(1980)
print("Expenses at the end of June:",exp) # [2200, 2350, 2600, 2130, 2190, 1980]

# 5. You returned an item that you bought in a month of April and
# got a refund of 200$. Make a correction to your monthly expense list
# based on this
exp[3] = exp[3] - 200
print("Expenses after 200$ return in April:",exp) # [2200, 2350, 2600, 1930, 2190, 1980]
