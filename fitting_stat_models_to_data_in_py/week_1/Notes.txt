Fiiting models to data- Goal-to help answer research questions 
Fit models to data not the other way around

Reason---
Estimaye distribution properties of variables
summarize relationships
predict value of the variables of intrerested conditional on vales on other predictor variables
-characterisation prediction uncertainty

Parametric models
-suggest variable of interest follows certain probability model
-estimate parameters that define models eg mean and variance
estimater model parameters + sampling variance = make inference abouyt the paramenters

idea of assessing model fit- does the modeel fits the data

eg taken - test performance and age
goals-
-estimate marginal mean of performance across the all ages
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''conditional on age

Mean onlyt model
-assume normal distribution pattern(good model, mean var)
-mean dfined by wuadritic func of age
a + b *age + c * (age ^2)
n = 200
-Hist and Q-Q plot
-scatter plot
regression model---
perf = m + e  (m = marginal mean, e = rand error)
#err norm dist with mean and var
m = 4.57
se = 0.10
var = 1.82
